/*
Explanation
In the above code,

Line 1â€“5: We create a function test with a for loop.
Line 6: We get the current time in milliseconds and store in a variable, start.
Line 7: We call the test method.
Line 8: We calculate the time taken to execute the test function by subtracting the current time from the start time, which we will store before executing the function.
Line 9: We print the time taken to execute the test function.
